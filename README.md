# Prework Study Guide 

## Description

I created this project as a reference to integral things I have learned through this bootcamp along with my extraneous research. It is an ever-evolving customized list that I can add notes to and refer back to when programming. The guide is intended aid me in my current and future studies. The bulk of what I learned was the features that Git provides. I got practice in  pulling and merging branches, writing issues, and keeping a consitent git workflow.
